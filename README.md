## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on **React.js** for frontend development and have been applying my skills to my Final Year Project (FYP), **KEnergy Link**.  

### About KEnergy Link  
KEnergy Link is a web-based solution aimed at improving customer service, trust, and transparency in the energy sector. The project is divided into three main modules:  
1. **Complaint Management**: This module is fully completed and focuses on efficiently handling customer complaints.  
2. **Consumption Analysis**: This module will utilize data analytics and machine learning to predict energy consumption trends.  
3. **Billing Methods**: This module aims to streamline bill payment processes and provide user-friendly billing options.  

The codebase for the **Complaint Management** module is available in my repository named **Complaint_Management**. Next, I'll be working on the remaining two modules to bring the full functionality of KEnergy Link to life.  

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work!
